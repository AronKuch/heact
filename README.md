# Health (or Heather) Care Tracker

To record medicine taking, symptom/side-effect experiencing, measurements and food intake.
For informing conversations with the oncologist.

## Design

The goal of the front end design is to keep it as quick/easy to enter data as possible. If information isn't getting in, then there's not a lot of use. The easier it is, the more it'll be used, the more data is collected, the more meaningful the data can be.
It opens to the data entry page, with an option to navigate away to other things.

## Naming

Sounds like "hacked", but spelled similar to React on which it's built.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
